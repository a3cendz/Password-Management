# Password-Management
a pretty cool and basic using python to create a password manager with some features.

# How to use
1. download the code as a zip file to your pc
2. extract the zip file using 7zip (easiest) or winrar idk
3. open up vscode (best) and open up the folder where the code is


# How to run
1. when its already on your vscode, open a new termianl and write "python" then the path to where your .py file.
   just open up windows file explorer, search where the py file is, click the bar twice and copy the path. so "ptyhon path/main.py"
2. thats it. now just use it. its pretty well-explained when u run it.

   HAVE FUN! MIGHT ADD MORE FEATURES. IT ALSO HAS SOME NOTES ON THE CODE IF U WANNA LEARN.
   MIGHT MAKE IT WORK WITH A GUI AND NOT FROM THE TERMINAL. IF SO, ILL MAKE A NEW BRANCH.
